# Puppet Bootstrap

## What is this

This directory contains a helper script and the answer files for standing up the
Puppet server infrastructures (masters, CA, Console, PuppetDB, and PostgreSQL).

It is not used in day-to-day Puppet use.

This is not used for other servers - it does not have anything to do with
bootstrapping agents.

## How to use this

Refer to the separate documentation for installation procedures.

Basically, you clone this Git repository to the server you're bootstrapping,
execute the `bootstrap.sh` script, select the server you're bootstrapping, and
follow any instructions provided by the script.
